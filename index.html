		    <p class="p-heading p-large">OrQA: Organ Quality Assessment is a multidisciplinary project involving academics, clinicians and software engineers. The aim of this project is to leverage moderm machine learning techniques to generate robust automated predictions of transplant viability from images of candidate organs. If you are involved in organ transplant and would like to learn more about how you can get involved <a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">please get in touch.</a></p>

			    <p> We are developing an application to facilitate transplant experts to view and assess images of organs for transplantability. We are currently looking for transplant professionals to get involved, so if you have the expertise to help we would love to <a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">hear from you!</a> </p>

                            <p> The main deliverable of this project will be a tool that allows surgeons to upload a photograph of an organ and receive an automated assessment of how viable the organ is for transplant. This is intended to support decision making around transplantation, in the hopes that we can increase the number of successful transplants in the UK and beyond.</p>
