## About

Transplantation is the best treatment for patients with organ failure irrespective of the organ required. Currently over 6,000
patients are waiting in the United Kingdom. Focusing on kidney transplantation the figures are stark with a patient living twice
as long with a transplant, when compared with dialysis, and over ten years a kidney transplant saves the NHS £420,000 per
patient.

Organs donated for transplantation are sometimes not used because of concerns about infections or cancer, but most
commonly because of worries that they won’t function adequately in the recipient and might lead directly to the patient dying. At
the moment assessing organs for transplantation is subjective and depends on the skills of the surgical team. In the United
Kingdom the rate of use of organs varies widely between centres, from 70% to 30%. This device aims to support all surgeons
to use the achievable 70% of donated organs.

This project will involve training machine learning models to score the quality of organs being considered for transplantation.
